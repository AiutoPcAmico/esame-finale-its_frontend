# Base React App - Frontend

This is a basic frontend for my basic react App.
It is made with React, a free framework for Node.js.
I also implemented MUI (Material UI) for some utils, like tables, input and navigation bar.

## Why I need a framework like React?

You could use plain Node.js, but it is very hard to create a big application. Using React, you don't need to think about reloads, saving data and other waste-time things.
Also, implementing MUI, you have a lot of components ready to use out-of-the-box

## This example is completed?

Of course, no.
In this simple frontend, I created some pages for basic operation with the backend. There are a lot of other things that can you do with a frontend!

## Why you created this repository?

I created this repository for all my future projects, to keep in mind the basics to run a simple React frontend
